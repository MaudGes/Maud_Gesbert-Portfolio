    "Standardizing non-binary columns, particularly continuous features, is crucial because these features often come in different scales and units. When features have large differences in range, models can become biased toward variables with larger scales, leading to poor performance. By standardizing—transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1—we ensure that each feature contributes equally during the learning process. This normalization improves the efficiency of many machine learning algorithms, especially those that rely on distance metrics or gradient descent, by stabilizing the optimization process and ultimately leading to better predictive results."
